"""Relational numeric domain — seam for Octagon / Polyhedra (deliberately a stub).

Relational domains track inter-variable *linear* invariants (Octagon:
``±x ± y ≤ c``; Polyhedra: ``A·x ≤ b``). Their value here is **opaque-predicate /
bogus-control-flow refutation**: proving a guard infeasible from accumulated
path constraints so the dead arm can be pruned. They are the right tool for
*linear* opaque predicates — but NOT for the bitwise/MBA ones OLLVM favours,
which belong to :mod:`known_bits` and to SMT/term-rewriting. So this is a
deliberately-deferred backend, exposed only as a typed seam.

``NullRelational`` is the safe default: it asserts nothing and refutes nothing
(``classify`` always ``UNKNOWN``), so wiring it in can never wrongly prune a
real branch. Swapping in a real (closed Octagon / LP-backed Polyhedra) backend
is a backend change behind :class:`RelationalDomain` — not an architecture
change. We do NOT ship a per-variable "box" mislabelled as relational, because a
silent under-pruner is worse than an honest ``UNKNOWN``.
